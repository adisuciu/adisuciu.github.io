Hello traveler, 

I am Adrian, I was born and raised in Transylvania. I'm currently working with software for a company called Analog Devices. My dad always says that nothing good comes easily, a saying that I've experienced one too many times so I created this blog to document this as well as different episodes of my life as a software engineer, dog owner, gamer, tinkerer, snowboarder.
